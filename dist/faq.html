							</Is it possible to have a second photographer?>
							<div class="faq__answear">
								<p>
									Of course! Liam prefers to shoot on his own for the consistency of his imagery and storytelling. He covers a lot of ground and moves around a great deal, and quite often a second shooter can easily pop up in the background of images which isn't ideal. Having said that we completely understand that sometimes you might prefer/it might be necessary to have a second shooter and so we have a number of really talented people that we can call on. A second shooter is charged at £100/hr.

							</How may photographs will Liam take and how many will we see?>
							<div class="faq__answear">
								<p>
									We have no fixed number. Liam will often take 1500+ photographs at a full day wedding, but it really is dependent on lots of factors like the number of locations throughout the day, the timings and the amount of time between the ceremony and wedding breakfast. Most full day weddings produce over 500 fantastic images. We only delete images that are duplicates, very poor light images, or where we might have caught you at an unflattering angle.

									It’s perfect for anyone who is nervous about being photographed, as once you’ve seen the results from the shoot you’ll have no fears or worries left about the formal photography part of your wedding day. It’s a really informal and fun shoot. By the end of it you will have relaxed in front of the camera and we’ll have learned how best to photograph you on your wedding day. It’s totally up to you to decide whether this is something you’d like to go for.
