				<p>You are bound to be feeling lots of different emotions on the morning of your big day – excited and nervous in equal measures!</p>
				<p>It’s such a lovely start to your day to spend those couple of hours of calm with the people you love, having a glass of fizz and getting all dolled up.</p>
				<p>Liam is mainly there to capture your preparations as they happen, in a story telling way, but he will also make sure he gets all the detail shots that make your wedding unique, along with some relaxed portraits of your bridal party.</p>
				<p>Some good tips to keep in mind are:</p>
				<h2>
					Ceremony

				<p>The bit where you get to say “I do!” Liam will have been at the church or ceremony venue for 20 minutes or so getting shots of your guests arriving and the groom waiting nervously, and will then capture you arriving and walking down the aisle. He will already have found a suitable spot to stand during the ceremony (although often we are not permitted to move around), and he will do his utmost to capture both of you during the ceremony in a discreet a way as possible.</p>
				<p>You’ll then sign the register which Liam will photograph in a documentary way, with some posed shots if this is something you’d like. Then you get to walk hand in hand down the aisle as husband and wife, ready to be greeted and congratulated by all your loved ones!</p>
				<p>Please keep in mind:</p>

				<p>We know that sometimes there is the temptation to have lots and lots of posed photographs of you and all of your guests. In our experience group photos can be STRESSFUL if there are too many, so we recommend around 10 combinations of the really important people to you (which will take around 20 minutes to capture). We’ll make sure we take lots of informal, documentary images of your guests too.</p>

				<p>This is your chance to get some awesome evening bride and groom shots. It’s only a really short session (20 mins tops), so that you’re not away from your guests and the party for too long – but t’s a great opportunity to get some really creative and unique photos. At this time of the day in the summer we get some beautiful low light and sunsets which look super pretty and romantic. If you are having a winter wedding or it is dark by this point Liam can also whip out his flash and do some creative flash-lit images.</p>

				<p>Liam will work in a completely documentary, story telling way during your reception and speeches – capturing all the laughs, giggles and ‘cringe’ moments as they happen.</p>
				<p>Some good tips for this part of the day are:</p>
				<p>-Do ask your wedding co-ordinator to stand well away from the top table – you don’t want them making an appearance in every picture.</p>
				<p>-Make sure your flower arrangements aren’t too high and blocking faces.</p>

				<p>Time to let your hair down and boogie! Liam will photograph your first dance in a documentary way, but will also set up some special lighting to give your first dance images a super cool touch. Expect lots of fun (maybe slightly embarrassing!) photos of your friends and family ‘throwing shapes’ on the dance floor :-)</p>

If we're unlucky enough that it does pour it down all day Liam has the equipment and experience to be able to capture all of your images indoors. It is advisable to have a couple of umbrellas on hand though, and possibly a spare pair of shoes that you don't mind getting a little damp or muddy!",
