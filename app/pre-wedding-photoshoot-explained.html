					What to Look for in a Good Table of Contents
				</h2>
				<p>
					A well designed and informative Table of Contents at the top of a post has several criteria.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Clearly Visible TOC heading. could be: “Table of Contents” or “Contents”
					</li>
					<li>
						Well Defined Bullet Points or Numbering System
					</li>
					<li>
						Scannable Titles
					</li>
					<li>
						Consistent Titles
					</li>
					<li>
						Visible Hierarchy for Items and Sub-items
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="section-2">
					Clearly Visible TOC Heading
				</h3>
				<p>
					Let people know exactly what they are looking at. In 95% of all examples below the TOC section is headed with the “Contents” of “Table of Contents.”
				</p>
				<h3 id="section-3">
					Bullet Points & Numbering System
				</h3>
				<p>
					You want the table of contents to be easily scanned read and understood. Having well defined bullet points or a number system really helps this.
				</p>
				<p>
					I prefer numbers because it helps the reader understand where they are in the article. Additionally, if you have sub-items being able to illustrate those with 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc the sub-items are even easier to see.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Scannable Titles
				</h3>
				<p>
					You want the short and sweet titles for each section of the post. If the titles in the table of contents are long and hard to understand people will just skip over the table of contents or even worse just leave your post altogether.
				</p>
				<p>
					Try to keep the number of words in each title between 2 to 5 words. I know all posts are different but the shorter the title the easier it becomes to scan and take in the entire article.
				</p>
				<h3 id="section-4">
					Consistent Titles
				</h3>
				<p>
					You want to keep the titles in the same “style”. This can be the same length, verb tense, or tone. By keeping the title similar, the reader can focus on the content and not have to think about what each title is.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Table of Contents Examples
				</h2>
				<h3>
					MacRumors: Mac Pro Rumors
				</h3>
				<p>
					Here Mac Rumors put the text on the right side and the content starts at the same point as the Table of Contents. I think this works because they have no right sidebar for widgets.

					DCRainmaker: Garmin Fenix 6 Review
				</h3>
				<p>
					DC Rainmaker is a fantastic site for all thing tech, endurance sports, cycling, running and just cool things in general. At this site they have implemented a table of contents for many years.
				</p>
				<p>
					The table of content appears in a fixed position on the screen and remains visible as the visitor scrolls down the page. I would imagine the usability is pretty easy and the engagement it high.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyway this is another great example of a table of content on a blog post.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thoughts: I really like the layout of the Table of Contents. The entire block appears to be centered horizontally in the column. The block has a light grey background allowing it to display as a unit giving it some definition. The block also appears to be 80% to 90% of the column width helping it to stand out even further.
				</p>
				<p>
					Design Notes: The width is 80% and the margin is set to auto
				</p>
				<p>
					Thoughts: I like how this table of contents is moved over to the right side and kept at the top of the page. This works because the site does not have a righthand sidebar. If the site had a right sidebar then this layout would not work.
				</p>
				<p>
					It should also be noted that this table of contents remains fixed on the page and goes off the screen when you scroll down the page. Many times when the table of content remains fixed on the screen it works because the TOC is outside the content area of the site.
