						<h2>
							Why did he start as a photographer?
						</h2>
						<p>Like many things in this world, everything starts with passion.</p>
						<p>Since childhood, he has tried to find a purpose in life. Something that drives him and brings value to others. He knew that he was naturally good with people and have an unhealthy attraction to different areas of visual communication. From paintings, billboard ads and illustrations to sculptures, tattoos and graphic design. He wanted to understand it all. He was drowning in the sea of information, unrealistic goals and fake expectations.</p>
						<p>He spent his early years doing marketing and digital consultancy when at some point he realised that he is not enjoying it. It was a turning point. At the age of 24, he decided to quit and moved to London with the idea of becoming a professional photographer.</p>
						<p>Now he is meeting with people and visiting places he couldn’t dream of. Every person – is a new unique story to capture. Every client – is a new creative challenge. The world is a playground.</p>
						<p>As he said: “I am fortunate to do something that I enjoy. For me it’s a privilege that I can call myself a photographer”.</p>
